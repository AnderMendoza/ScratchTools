# v1.3
This new update has all the features from v1.2, but the project links on profile comments being replaced with their titles becomes possible on all profiles, not just yours!

# v1.4
This update has a very big feature, a suggestion added on our [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/5AkUsCbEsy) by [ScratchFangs](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Scratchfangs/) on Scratch: you can now press a button when searching through projects to see ALL the projects- even the ones that usually wouldn't show up in the search because they're rated as NFE (Not For Everyone- not bad enough to be banned, but possibly not for the younger people of Scratch).

Other than that, this has all the features of v1.3- but get ready! v2.0 will be a BIG update!

# v1.5
This brand new update that brings some new features to the table, and fixes some unifficient code and other bugs!

### What we did:
- The "TurboWarp Editor" button now shows as soon as the editor is opened up, rather than a few seconds after
- The current sprite's costume watermark in the top right corner of the block editor has now been hidden
- A badge has been put on the profiles of Official ScratchTools [Bug Bounty](https://discord.gg/5AkUsCbEsy) members

# v1.6
This update adds some **HUGE** new features, and fixes some bugs.

### What we did:
- On profiles, you can hover over a project's title to display the entire title
- Added the `*` next to the usernames of Scratch Team members in the forum
- Fixed a bug where the statistics button went to the wrong website for users with long usernames (thanks to [JoePotatoScratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/JoePotatoScratch/) for reporting it)
- Fixed a bug with the TurboWarp button where it wasn't displaying

# v1.7
We added some **super** fun new features, and also some helpful ones!

### What we did:
- On profiles, you can hover over any username in the comments to display their bio
- We added a St. Patrick's Day feature
- We added a *very* secret April Fool's Day feature

# v1.8
This was a **HUGE** update, because we added in a settings page, where you can choose which features to see in action. Other than that, not much happened, other than us removing one feature. But, we believe that both of these changes helped ScratchTools and all of its users.

# v1.9
This version just fixed a major bug having to do with the settings for ScratchTools. We didn't add in any features, but now the settings work.

# v2.0
This is one of our **BIGGEST** updates yet, and we're excited to share it with you! We added a bunch of new features and fixed some major bugs! Introducing, ScratchTools v2.0!

# v2.1
This version fixed a bug that was hiding the settings button until you went to the settings page.

### What we did:
- In the editor, you can remove the dots from the dotted background
- You can now save posts as drafts in the forums
- Replace the Scratch News section with your recent projects
- Put the ScratchTools settings button in the footer
- Automatically open links from project pages in a new tab
- Ocular buttons next to usernames in the forums
- Slider for outline in the paint editor
- Remove the icons for the block, paint, and sound editors
- Fixed the bug that hid the ScratchTools Settings
- Fixed the bug that didn't show editor features when you first made a project
