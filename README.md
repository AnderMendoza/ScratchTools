## Fun Facts About ScratchTools
### ScratchTools v1.0 was approved on 2/22/22
While ScratchTools was published later during a livestream, it was approved for the Chrome Webstore by the Google Team very late at night on 2/22/22!

## In the Future for v1.2
So far, we've added a feature that will replace project links in profile comments with the name of the project, but the hyperlink will stay. We've also added a feature so that a popup with a link to the GitHub repository will appear after opening Scratch for the first time after v1.2 of ScratchTools has been installed.
