Scratchtools for Firefox! [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/5AkUsCbEsy).

## About
Firefox is different from other browsers. Most browsers (eg. Chrome) use Chromium. Firefox uses its own version, so we have to alternate the extension so it is compatible with Firefox. Otherwise it doesnt work at all.

## Changes

- [ ] Change background.js
