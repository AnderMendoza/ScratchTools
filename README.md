## v1.1
While Version 1.0 was waiting to be approved by the Chrome Webstore, a new feature was added for Version 1.1. The feature was a "Show Password" checkbox upon sign in on the Scratch Homepage. Version 1.1 also fixed the bugs from Version 1.0, fixing a file that was missing.

# v1.3
This new update has all the features from v1.2, but the project links on profile comments being replaced with their titles becomes possible on all profiles, not just yours!

# v1.4
This update has a very big feature, a suggestion added on our [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/5AkUsCbEsy) by [ScratchFangs](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Scratchfangs/) on Scratch: you can now press a button when searching through projects to see ALL the projects- even the ones that usually wouldn't show up in the search because they're rated as NFE (Not For Everyone- not bad enough to be banned, but possibly not for the younger people of Scratch).

Other than that, this has all the features of v1.3- but get ready! v2.0 will be a BIG update!
